Terrible quality control, bought it twice and arrived both times with heavy problems, first with a cracked speaker, making it impossible to hear anything and then with apparently no battery whatsoever as it won't even turn on this time. If your lucky you might get one in good shape but I would recommend you to save yourself some time and displeasure and go buy another brand of speaker. Very bad product.
