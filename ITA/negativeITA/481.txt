I bought a Kindle Fire because I have seen the hardware specifications, it has very good hardware and very good specs. But it has a bad operating system that is far from android and far from what I wanted. I regret that I bought it. I will buy an ANDROID capable of running CYANOGENMOD at another store. I feel like returning it right away. I would prefer to not even receive the product than to receive such a product, Buy anything but a kindle. Prefer Android devices that can run alternative firmware.
