I bought this SD memory card to use for my photo camera. in the second day of using it, the camera could not save files on it. I tried to format it by camera, laptop, desktop, different setting such as NTFS, FAT32, ... but finally it does not work, and is useless. You can imagine I cannot use my SLR camera because I do not have another SD card!
