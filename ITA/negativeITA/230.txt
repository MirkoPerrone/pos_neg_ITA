I've just got back from a holiday and this Transcend gave me the worse result ever: after 5 days I was shooting beautiful pictures my brand new canon G12 displayed this message: memory card error! So I had to buy a new one and I lost all the pictures of the first days because I couldn't save it at all on any PC, MAC, or hard disk. I even brought it to a data recovery specialist who tried for several days but gave up. Very very bad, the worse thing can happen to your happy memories. Definitely I don't reccomend it to anyone.
